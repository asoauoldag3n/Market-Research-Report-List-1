<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poliomyelitis Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IPV</li><li>OPV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Poliomyelitis vaccines are critical in preventing poliovirus infections. The two main types are Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV). IPV is administered via injection and contains killed virus, providing strong immunity without the risk of vaccine-derived paralysis. OPV, on the other hand, is given orally and contains live attenuated virus, promoting herd immunity but potentially causing vaccine-derived cases in rare instances. Both vaccines play crucial roles in global efforts to eradicate polio.</p></p>
