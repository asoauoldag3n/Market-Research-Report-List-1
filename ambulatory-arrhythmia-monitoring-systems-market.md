<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ambulatory Arrhythmia Monitoring Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External</li><li>Implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring systems encompass two primary types: external and implantable devices. External monitors, such as Holter monitors and event recorders, are non-invasive and worn on the body for short-term data collection, enabling the detection of arrhythmias during daily activities. Implantable monitors, like loop recorders, are surgically placed under the skin for long-term monitoring, offering continuous cardiac data. Both types facilitate timely diagnosis and management of arrhythmias, catering to varying patient needs and healthcare settings.</p></p>
